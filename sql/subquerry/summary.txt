well the sub querry is like making functions 
==> is taking data due to a sertain code

types of sub querry
 > single row 
    
    # returns only single data column or row
    # commonly used in checking conditions if are met (<,>,=)

    eg
        sql ```
                SELECT * FROM Employees
                    WHERE
                    salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees);
            ```

 > Multiple row
    
    # returns multiple data rows
    # used in operators like IN ANY ALL ON 

    eg
        sql```
            SELECT EmpName FROM Employees
                WHERE DepartmentID IN (
                    SELECT DepartmentID FROM Department
                        WHERE DepartmentName = 'HR' OR DepartmentName = 'Finance'
                );
        ```

 > Multiple column
    # Returns multiple rows and multiple columns
    # Typically used in WHERE clause with operators like IN

    eg 
        ```sql
                SELECT EmpName FROM Employees
                    WHERE 
                    (DepartmentID, salary) IN (
                        SELECT DepartmentID, MAX(salary) FROM Department
                    );
        ```

        ```sql
            SELECT EmpName FROM Employees
                WHERE DepartmentID = (
                    SELECT DepartmentID FROM Employees
                        WHERE 
                        EmpName = 'Jane Doe'
                );
        ```

        ```sql
            SELECT EmpName FROM Employees
                WHERE jobTitle = (
                    SELECT jobTitle FROM Employees
                        WHERE 
                        DepartmentID = 10
                );
        ```

        ```sql       
                --well ANY is mostly from the qn provided so just look carefuly
                SELECT EmpName FROM Employees
                    WHERE salary > ANY (
                        SELECT MAX(salary) FROM  Employees
                        WHERE
                        DepartmentID = 20
                    );
        ```

        ```sql       
                --well ALL is mostly from the qn provided so just look carefuly
                SELECT EmpName FROM Employees
                    WHERE salary > ALL (
                        SELECT MAX(salary) FROM  Employees
                        WHERE
                        DepartmentID = 20
                    );
